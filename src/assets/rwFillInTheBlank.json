'It is this southern fault that ruptured during the earthquake. Stress had been # up here since the last large earthquake along that fault, in 1751”. “As geologists, we think in different time-frames, Rose says. “An occurrence of every 200-plus years is not long when we talk in terms of millions of years. The fault is actually similar to the San Andreas Fault in California, Rose says. And one unique # of quakes like this is that they may occur in 'timed clusters where, when one part releases, others close by may follow.",

The # of the rail linking the town of Visp to the village of Zermatt started in 1888. On July 18,1891, the first train reached Zermatt and the entire train line was electrified in 1930. Since 1930, the Glacier Express panoramic train directly connects the village to St. Moritz However, no connection exists with the village of Breuil-Cervinia on the Italian side. Travelers need to hire guides to cross the glaciated Theodul Pass, separating the resorts. Zermatt remains almost free of internal combustion # and is only connected by train. Apart from the local police which uses cars, only electric vehicles are used. Cable-car and rail # have been built to make the area mare accessible. In 1898, the Gornergrat railway, reaching a record altitude of 3,100 meters, was inaugurated. Areas served by cable car are the Klein Matterhorn and the Unterrothorn.",
